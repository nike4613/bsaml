I went through hell and back to get these assemblies. System.Windows.Extensions is based on the .NET 5 preview 8 source for it, but retargeted to netstandard2.0 (and of course having quite a few cuts to accomadate that). System.Xaml is bsed on the System.Xaml project in the WPF 5.0.0-preview.8 tag, retargeted to Framework 4.7.1, with minor changes to accomadate that. If you want to try to recompile these from source yourself, go ahead. I don't recommend it.
